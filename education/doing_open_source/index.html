# _Open Source and why you should care_

## _About me_
-------------

My name is Edgar Aroutiounian, I'm a versatile programmer with many
different interests like functional programming, programming
language theory, type systems, compilers, iOS.

I worked in San Francisco and decided to leave in late July 2016 when
I thought about the April Artsakh war and the Erebuni
Police station debacle.

I work with many different programming languages, styles of coding;
my favorite language is [`OCaml`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml), 
google it.

## _What is Open Source?_
-------------------------

Open source is a few things:

1. ...its culture

2. ...its community

3. ...its opportunity

4. ...its a way to learn quickly

5. ...its code whose source is open and available to reuse, free of charge.

## _What is Open Source?_
-------------------------
Here's a famous
[example](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA%5B1-25%5D)

```
Linus Benedict Torvalds 8/25/91

Hello everybody out there using minix -
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.  This has been brewing
since april, and is starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on
things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
among other things).

I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. 
This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and
I'd like to know what features most people would want.  Any suggestions
are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

Linus (torv...@kruuna.helsinki.fi)

PS.  Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. 
It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

### _Open Source_
-----------------
Besides Linux, other famous open source projects you might have heard of include:

Docker, Python, Ruby, FreeBSD, git, Angular, React, jquery and much more.

Open source is the standard way that software is developed in Silicon Valley,
you get a massive advantage of developing code out in the open.

Another underappreciated bonus, by developing out in the open you can have 
many people see your code, "With enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

### _How do I get started?_
---------------------------
Notice that I put point **5** on the earlier slide as the last one. 

Open source is really culture, a mentality of programmers 
working together on a common technical goal. You engage the greater
coding community when you work together with other programmers.

The easiest way to get started is to find a topic or project that 
you're interested in and starting bug fixing. If the project you like
is on `Github`, then go through the issues and fix the small bugs.

### _Benefits to you_
---------------------
You get several:

1. You get better at coding, always a good thing.

2. You learn new technologies, new libraries, new languages.

3. There's a record of your coding, people can verify that you actually can code

4. You build relationships with other coders, make new friends.

5. Job offers! I've gotten job offers, interviews 
   from Facebook, Google, DropBox and many others simply from people knowing 
   about me and seeing my [open source work](https://github.com/fxfactorial).
   I have code running in Facebook and I don't even work there.

### _Wrapping up_
-----------------

We have a hackerspace in Yerevan called [iterate](http://iteratehackerspace.github.io/)
All our code there is open source, here is the source code of the our
winning entry at the fintegration hackathon:
