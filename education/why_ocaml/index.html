## _About me_
---------------
Many of you know about me, I code in many different languages.
After coding so much in so many different languages I have 
come to some opinions about what I want from a coding language.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Language qualifications_
----------------------------
1. The language should produce fast code

2. The language should not force on me styles of coding.

3. The language should be fun to code in.

4. The language should have a strong type system.

5. The langauge should have a good ecosystem of developer tools.

6. The language should work on multiple platforms.

7. The language should have support for generic programming.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Language qualifications cont..._
------------------------------------
Fast code usually means compiled code, so this rules out 
all the interpreted languages, so no Python, Ruby, JavaScript.
=> OCaml compiles to native code or bytecode

Not forcing style on me rules out Java, C# 
(They force object-oriented code) => OCaml lets me write
functional style code by default but Objects and mutation 
still exist and are easy to use.

Fun to code in rules out Java, its extremely verbose, also 
rules out C, it forces you to think about small details like 
memory allocation, pointers. => OCaml is garbage collected with 
one of the fastest garbage collectors out there.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Language qualifications cont..._
------------------------------------
Strong type system requirements rules out all the interpreted
languages, they are uni-typed, very type unsafe. Some language
type systems suck like Java, very verbose and forces you to write 
awkward code. (Basically want no `NULL` pointers.) => OCaml 
has one of the strongest type systems out there, its based on
the lambda calculus and 
[Hindleyâ€“Milner type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system)

All the big name languages now have pretty good developer tools.
=> OCaml has [merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin), probably
the most powerful static analyzer for languages, can work on broken ASTs,
it is context sensitive.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Language qualifications cont..._
------------------------------------
Most languages support multiple platforms => OCaml compiles to
`x86`, `ARM` (including iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi), `sparc` and it has
two to JavaScript compilers.

Only applicable to the compiled languages, C completely fails here, C++ is 
very good at it, Java's generic are crap, just compiler casting for you.
=> OCaml has one of the most powerful module systems, with functors letting
you make new modules at runtime.

## _Coming to OCaml_
--------------------
I first encountered OCaml in my compilers course at Columbia university.
A compiler is a program that converts source code into machine code for a 
computer to run, like `gcc`, `clang`.

About six months after that course I began looking for a new language to learn, 
to be very good in. After going through the reasons I mentioned, I came down 
to two choices, `OCaml` and `Haskell`. I didn't choose `Haskell` because it forces
you code in a functional style and introduces difficult concepts early on; monads 
and its lazily evaluated, which I don't like to be forced into.

	  <script type="text/template">
## _Coming to OCaml cont..._
---------------------------
So given this situation I picked `OCaml` and for several months sat at home and 
taught myself deeper OCaml.
Here's the first program I made, 
a space invaders type game, source: [code](https://github.com/fxfactorial/lambda-invaders)

## _So what does it look like?_
-------------------------------
Here's an example from my `brozip` program.
![](./why_ocaml_example.png)

Notice this program has no intermediary variables, the data flows in one direction.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Type system_ 
----------------
The type system is very, very strong. There is no such thing as a `NULL` pointer
in the language, it simply does not exist.
![](./usbmux_example.png)

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Type system cont..._ 
------------------------
The type system + `merlin` let you know the type of anything, 
and the types are inferred. Inferred types means we don't have to write verbose 
things like:

```
Person armo = new Person('Gor', 27);
```
Why do we have to say Person twice on the same line? We'd like the compiler
to figure out that the variable of `armo` is of type `Person`.

## _Type system cont..._

OCaml + `merlin` figure this out for us:

## _Final thoughts_
-------------------
Always be coding and enjoy what you do, know at least two programming languages
deeply.
