# _iOS reverse engineering_

## an introduction

## _Quick about me_
-------------------

My name is Edgar Aroutiounian, I'm a versatile programmer with many
different interests like functional programming, programming
language theory, type systems, compilers, iOS.

I worked in San Francisco and decided to leave in late July when
I thought about the April Artsakh war and the Erebuni
Police station debacle.

I work with many different programming languages, styles of coding;
my favorite language is `OCaml`, google it.

## _Some Basics_
----------------

1. _iOS_ is the most secure mobile operating system out there.

2. Because _Apple_ owns the hardware as well as the software, they 
   are able to create extra secure systems, from the bootloader 
   to especially the encryption, which gets a boost from the CPU.

3. You'll need to have a jailbroken device to get anything serious done.
   Jailbreaking means having the ability to sign your own code and 
   running arbitrary code, it means having the entire device available 
   to you. (HINT: Its a _UNIX_ system!)
	  </script>

### _What kind of knowledge is needed for iOS RE_?
--------------------------------------------------

1. ...be comfortable with _UNIX_, since iOS is basically BSD

2. ...understand _git_ since most tools and code are distributed via _git_

3. ...know _C_ & practical _C_ coding, sometimes some _C++_

4. ...know _Objective-C_, since, well duh...

5. ...able to use _Makefile_ & _Make_

6. ...understand compiling/linking, since you'll be compiling tools
   and linking in your code.

7. ...little bit of _ARM_ assembly, (hopper and IDA make this easy).
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _What can you do with such knowledge_?
------------------------------------------

Some examples:

1. Get a million dollars instantly for finding a zero-day in _iOS_ itself.

2. Create _tweaks_, that is create functionality changes
   in existing apps. There is a jailbreak app store called _Cydia_ where
   you can distribute your work for free or for payment.

3. Get a professional job doing security work in iOS, mostly in 
   Miami, Israel.

4. Have a lot of fun and understand _iOS_ much deeper, good for 
   regular app developers too.

### _Getting started_
---------------------

1. Work on _OSX_ or _Linux_

2. Have a jailbroken _iOS_ device, can check if its eligible with
   [canijailbreak.com](http://canijailbreak.com)

3. Use `theos`, this is like a build system for jailbreak development, 
   can get it at [github.com/theos/theos](https://github.com/theos/theos). 
   Look at the FAQs, theos generates some premade template _Makefiles_ that
   make it easy to get started.

4. Use tools like `class-dump` to get a interface dump of the app
   you're interested in tweaking/code injecting, if more interested in
   reverse engineering at a lower level, you'll need to decrypt the binary
   since iOS binaries are encrypted, use tools like 
   `clutch` or `dumpdecrypted`.

### _Slight detour into recon_
------------------------------

Reverse engineering isn't just about opening binaries, but also recon. 
I mentioned tools like `class-dump`. Another thing you want to usually do
is see what kind of `HTTP` requests an app is doing; you need to 
_man in the middle_ attack the device. You can do that easily with 
`mitmproxy`.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
 ### _Directly on the device_
 ------------------------------

When you work on the device, you can code all kinds of 
code injection techniques. One simple example I've written about
[here](http://hyegar.com/2016/08/31/grabbing-function-location/).

The short version is that you do:

```
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=code_injection.dylib ./inject_me
```
Where a `.dylib` is `OS X`/`iOS`'s version of a `.so` and the `.dylib`
is where you put your appropriate memory offset function pointer and the
`inject_me` is the binary you're targeting.

This kind of work is made easier with `Cydia Substrate`, a 
new alternative is called `Frida`.

	  <script type="text/template">
### _and the interesting things you find in apps..._
----------------------------------------------------

Developers are human and human are usually a bit lazy

People leave in their apps, both in the binary and in the `IPA`
all kinds of goodies like `AWS` passwords, entire `.git` repos 
and even `TLS` certs which can be converted into `ssh` keys...

### _Wrapping up_
----------------

Shameless plug: I'm trying to establish a hackerspace in Yerevan, 
see the presentation at http://hyegar.com/hackerspace
a place of learning all kinds of skills.
